# Description
I used OpenAI's Acrobot enviroment to implement a Q-learning agent. I used Tensorflow/Keras to implement the neural network.

# Results
This is a gif of the learned policy. Pretty cool!



# Tensorflow and Virtual Enviroment Setup
It is easiest to run Tensorflow from a virtual enviroment on Linux. Here are instructions on how to setup Tensorflow and the virtual enviroment https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-ubuntu-18-04/

To activate the virtual enviroment: ```source venv/bin/activate```

# How to Run My Code
```python3 acrobot.py```
